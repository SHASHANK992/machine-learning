General Instruction:
1. Uncomment code based on the dataset for which the code should run
2. Some graphs were made in Excel/Numbers and exported to CSV files, some are made in the code using Matplotlib


Run em.py for EM
Run kmeans.py for K-means
Run neural_pca.py for running PCA before Neural Networks
Run neural_ica.py for running ICA before Neural Networks
Run kmeans_euclidean.py for Euclidean Distance, modify _k_means.py in scikit for changing euclidean distance to cosine.
