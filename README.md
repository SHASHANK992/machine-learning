Data Sources
* [Phishing Websites Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/phishing+websites#)
* [Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits)

Prerequisites:
* Install all the dependent python libraries - scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy and pandas
* util.py provides utlity function to input data and print learning curves abstracted for other files

Decision Tree:
* Remove line 85 and replace it with a function call to `draw_learning_curve_1()` to `draw_learning_curve_2()` to create the learning curves for Phishing Dataset and Optical Recognition Dataset, respectively. Modify line 84 with X1, Y1 or X2, Y2 to pick the dataset.
* Additionally, a 3-D graph can be generated with the function `testBothParams()` and max depth graph can be generated by calling `testMaxDepth()`
