Data Sources
* [Phishing Websites Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/phishing+websites#)
* [Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits)

Prerequisites:
* Install all the dependent python libraries - scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy and pandas
* util.py provides utlity function to input data and print learning curves abstracted for other files
* Store the .py files and data in the same folder

Decision Tree:
* In DecisionTree.py, remove line 85 and replace it with a function call to `draw_learning_curve_1()` to `draw_learning_curve_2()` to create the learning curves for Phishing Dataset and Optical Recognition Dataset, respectively. Modify line 84 with X1, Y1 or X2, Y2 to pick the dataset.
* Additionally, a 3-D graph can be generated with the function `testBothParams()` and max depth graph can be generated by calling `testMaxDepth()`

KNN:
* Follow same steps as Decision Trees by calling functions to create graphs using KNN.py

SVM:
* Use either plot function to plot the graphs

Neural Network : Multilayer Perceptron:
* The code in MultiLayerPerceptron.py generates epoch curves for Phishing Data, uncomment the last block and comment lines 85 to 98 to generate them for Optical Recognition Dataset

Boosting:
* Uncomment line 41 to 62 to create graphs for Optical Recognition Dataset, change `learning_rate` or `max_depth` to create  graphs for a higher or lower learning_rate or depth
* Comment the block for Phishing or create two sub plots
